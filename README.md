# ComputeShaderTest

This is a project i used to learn how to use opengl compute shader. Most codes are copied from the book OpenGL Programming Guide and the welsite LearnOpenGL. I also use some open source project, including GLFW, GLAD and GLM. I don't give the license of these libraries, which is not a good point.

If you want to run this project, you need Visual Studio 2022 because i haven't test on the other version of vs. You can just copy these codes to your project.
